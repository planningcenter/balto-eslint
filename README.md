# üê∫ Balto

Balto is Smart and Fast:

* Installs _your_ version of eslint
* Installs _your_ versions of eslint and eslint plugins
* _Only_ runs on files that have changed
* _Only_ annotates lines that have changed

Sample config (place in `.github/workflows/balto.yml`):

```yaml
name: Balto

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: planningcenter/balto-eslint@v0.1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          extensions: "js,jsx"
```
