# üê∫ Balto

Balto is Smart and Fast:

* _Only_ runs on files that have changed
* _Only_ annotates lines that have changed

## Sample config

(place in `.github/workflows/balto.yml`):

```yaml
name: Balto

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  # Note: the name of this job will be how annotations are labeled
  balto-eslint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Alternatively, use planningcenter/balto-utils/npm@v2
      - uses: planningcenter/balto-utils/yarn@v2
      - uses: planningcenter/balto-eslint@v1
```

## Contributing

1. Install [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/)
2. `devbox setup`
3. `devbox test`

This will simulate a balto workflow like the above sample config that you can
inspect for accuracy. At time of writing, there are not automated tests (PRs
welcome!).
